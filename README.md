Many companies have BI teams and marketing teams.  These teams are often under sepearate managers, with separate quarterly goals, and many times don't know what either team is working on.  Some marketing team members have aptitude for analysis and some BI developers have aptitude for marketing.  Growth marketers bridge the gap between BI developers, marketing teams, software engineers, product managers, designers, and business leaders.
